Even if just in the scenario of a user experiencing a bug (not my case) and being able to revert whatever the bug caused could be helpful for users.
In general, it is one of those ""shortcut"" actions most people know, so it would also give points for the intuitiveness of the tool!","Yes","Yes. I, for one, messed around with the positions to make the text as readable as possible. The appearance / visual side of the diagrams is very important for their comprehension.","Yes","Intuitiveness.

- Undo feature (with button + keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Z)
- An easier way to make the links. Maybe, when creating a link, the sidebar immediately opens with the option to select the source and target. The user could then just click the elements they want as each one to associate the link to the elements.

Comments:
I found the tool very pleasing to use on the visual side and very intuitive. I would definitely like to have had something like this over alternatives that are either limited because they require payment or existing free alternatives that seem a bit too disconnected from UML or are just a barely optimized or bettered ""Insert Figure"" function (like in Microsoft Office software)."

I'm used to using tools like LucidChart and one of the things I think I waste most time there is searching for the components I want to work with; this tool shows all the existent components right away and it's much easier to select them. Besides that, it's easier to edit the components using this platform rather than those usual tools. The children feature is also great and very helpful.","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","I was able to do all the tasks from this experiment with ease and in a short amount of time, at least I believe it was short. It's true that the student gave a short explanation before the experiment but I believe the platform is simpler enough that one might have figured out everything without the demonstration. I also believe that the short explanatory text that contributes to the ease-of-use of this tool.","Agree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Disagree","Agree","Strongly Disagree","The tool is very easy to use and I believe that due to that simplicity it's a worthy substitute for other diagram making tools that most times are way too complicated for what one wants to do with them.","Yes","I didn't have the misfortune of making a mistake during this experiment but I can see how it could happen easily. And even though, it didn't happen now, I can see it happen to me in the future. Not even just for errors but even if one just thinks better of something and wants to change what they have done, it would be very useful.","Yes","This feature is important both for design purposes (a person might want the diagram to look a certain way: certain components next to each other) and for comprehensibility/visibility purposes (a component might be on top of others or the text in a link might not be readable due to components being on top of it). ","Yes","I don't use keyboard that much, I prefer to use the mouse but sometimes you just want to move components a little little bit which is impossible with the mouse so for that I think it's useful.","Yes","It has all necessary components available and allow to the necessary connections so yes.","Just for design purposes might be nice in the future to allow users to pick the colors of components and text? Also I believe the redo feature would be very useful.

Besides that I would like to congratulate the maker of the tool, it's awesome and it looks great. Great job :))"

That allows for a user to quickly learn in and develop their tasks. On the other hand, it might be that not all of the functionalities of other UML tools is available which might make some tasks not feasible.

It it easy to get to know all of the functionalities and start to work right away. It might be a little too complex in the way that links work since their implementation seems to differ from most UML alternatives and require you to select from a dropdown.","Yes","""Oh no! I hit delete. My 20-properties component is gone!""
Besides being standard practice, undo and redo actions help the user allowing them to experiment with their work and allow them to undo mistakes","Yes","For more complex architectures, the user might want to move elements not only so there is fewer overlap of links (making the readability of the UML simpler), but also to show correlation of objects more or less based on their location.","Yes","While not absolutely necessary, it increases usability and productivity for more experienced users. They can execute simpler tasks in less time. It also provides alternatives for machines without a mouse.","No","No. I found lacking support for some of the functionalities of UML such as composition, generalization and multiplicity. Please disregard this opinion if such properties and characteristics are not supposed to exist in architecture UMLs for which the software appears to be tailored to.","Maybe consider a fullscreen mode where the diagram editor is not encapsulated within a page but is the page itself. At least for a the later phases of the software and not for the experiment.
The possibility do perform this type of analysis (of a docker file) to fully fledged repositories and object classes would be absolutely extraordinary.
Encountered a bug. Didnºt try to replicate but pretty sure it was when trying to delete a connection that didn't have neither a target nor a source."

Because most of the interactions are based on clicks and lists of values, it becomes easy to understand how to use the tool and use it to build diagrams easily, but with the growth of the diagrams, some currently used mechanisms might not be that scalable, particularly the use of the dropdown of all elements to choose a link source or target.","Agree","Neither","Agree","Disagree","Agree","Strongly Disagree","Agree","Disagree","Neither","Disagree","The tool is quite intuitive and not overwhelming. It has the necessary elements well organized on the page, and the display of the diagram and the information panel are well organized.","Yes","Because one of the most frequent things that happen are missclicks, and it is important to think that the user is dumb and will always make a mess, and that way, we can diminish the possible rage a delete would cause.","Yes","To readjust the layout automatically generated, and to avoid elements getting on top of each other and improve the visual semantics of the diagram.","No","","Yes","","Suggestions:
- add a link should add it right away to the screen, even if it had no connections, to make it easier to find and edit its properties (maybe in a section where all the initially created elements would go and not yet altered to make it easier to find and separate from the other ones)
- the delete of an element shouldnºt delete the links associated with it, only the element itself, or else it will be necessary to create all the connections again
- the dropdown boxes for the source and target choice should be a dropdown with search to help identify the wanted element on the list
- in editing the properties of a link, it could show close to the source and the target what side corresponds to each tip, mainly in the cases where the links are not equal on the 2 sides
- the total number of links and elements listed could be beside the title of those sections
- add filters in the element/link lists by type to help find a specific element/link

Bugs found during the experiment:
- after selecting the type of link to add; in the alert, the ""cancel"" button doesnºt seem to be working
- if an element in the visual editor is selected, when clicking a link in the list of links to edit its properties, it looks like it doesnºt change the window."
