Even if just in the scenario of a user experiencing a bug (not my case) and being able to revert whatever the bug caused could be helpful for users.

- Undo feature (with button + keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Z)
- An easier way to make the links. Maybe, when creating a link, the sidebar immediately opens with the option to select the source and target. The user could then just click the elements they want as each one to associate the link to the elements.

Comments:
I found the tool very pleasing to use on the visual side and very intuitive. I would definitely like to have had something like this over alternatives that are either limited because they require payment or existing free alternatives that seem a bit too disconnected from UML or are just a barely optimized or bettered ""Insert Figure"" function (like in Microsoft Office software)."

I'm used to using tools like LucidChart and one of the things I think I waste most time there is searching for the components I want to work with; this tool shows all the existent components right away and it's much easier to select them. Besides that, it's easier to edit the components using this platform rather than those usual tools. The children feature is also great and very helpful.","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","I was able to do all the tasks from this experiment with ease and in a short amount of time, at least I believe it was short. It's true that the student gave a short explanation before the experiment but I believe the platform is simpler enough that one might have figured out everything without the demonstration. I also believe that the short explanatory text that contributes to the ease-of-use of this tool.","Agree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Disagree","Agree","Strongly Disagree","The tool is very easy to use and I believe that due to that simplicity it's a worthy substitute for other diagram making tools that most times are way too complicated for what one wants to do with them.","Yes","I didn't have the misfortune of making a mistake during this experiment but I can see how it could happen easily. And even though, it didn't happen now, I can see it happen to me in the future. Not even just for errors but even if one just thinks better of something and wants to change what they have done, it would be very useful.","Yes","This feature is important both for design purposes (a person might want the diagram to look a certain way: certain components next to each other) and for comprehensibility/visibility purposes (a component might be on top of others or the text in a link might not be readable due to components being on top of it). ","Yes","I don't use keyboard that much, I prefer to use the mouse but sometimes you just want to move components a little little bit which is impossible with the mouse so for that I think it's useful.","Yes","It has all necessary components available and allow to the necessary connections so yes.","Just for design purposes might be nice in the future to allow users to pick the colors of components and text? Also I believe the redo feature would be very useful.

Besides that I would like to congratulate the maker of the tool, it's awesome and it looks great. Great job :))"

That allows for a user to quickly learn in and develop their tasks. On the other hand, it might be that not all of the functionalities of other UML tools is available which might make some tasks not feasible.

I hit delete. My 20-properties component is gone!""
Besides being standard practice, undo and redo actions help the user allowing them to experiment with their work and allow them to undo mistakes","Yes","For more complex architectures, the user might want to move elements not only so there is fewer overlap of links (making the readability of the UML simpler), but also to show correlation of objects more or less based on their location.","Yes","While not absolutely necessary, it increases usability and productivity for more experienced users. They can execute simpler tasks in less time. It also provides alternatives for machines without a mouse.","No","No. I found lacking support for some of the functionalities of UML such as composition, generalization and multiplicity. Please disregard this opinion if such properties and characteristics are not supposed to exist in architecture UMLs for which the software appears to be tailored to.","Maybe consider a fullscreen mode where the diagram editor is not encapsulated within a page but is the page itself. At least for a the later phases of the software and not for the experiment.
The possibility do perform this type of analysis (of a docker file) to fully fledged repositories and object classes would be absolutely extraordinary.
Encountered a bug. Didnºt try to replicate but pretty sure it was when trying to delete a connection that didn't have neither a target nor a source."

Como maior parte das interações são à base de clicks e listas de valores torna-se facil de perceber como usar a tool para tirar partido desta para construir diagramas mais facilmente, mas no entanto com o crescimento dos diagramas alguns mecanismos atualmente usados poderão não ser tão escaláveis, particularmente o uso de dropdown de todos os elementos para escolher a parte inicial ou final de um link.","Agree","Neither","Agree","Disagree","Agree","Strongly Disagree","Agree","Disagree","Neither","Disagree","A ferramenta é bastante intuitiva e não overwhelming.

- adicionar um link devia adiciona-lo logo à tele ainda que sem ligações para ser mais facil de o encontrar e editar as suas propriedas (talvez numa secao para onde iriam todos os elementos inicialmente criados e ainda nao alterados para serem mais faceis de encontrar e separar do resto)
- o delete de um elemento nao deveria eliminar os links a ele associados, apenas o elemento em si, senao será necessário voltar a criar todas as ligações
- as caixas dropdown na escolha do source e target devia ser um dropdown com search para ajudar a identificar o elemento desejado na lista
- na edição das propriedades do link podia ter ao lado da source e do target a que lado corresponde cada ponta, principalmente em casos onde os links nao sao igual dos 2 lados
- o número total de links e elementos listados poderia estar ao lado do titulo dessas secoes
- adicionar filtros na lista de elementos/link por tipo pode ajudar a encontrar um dado elemento/link

Bugs encontrados durante a experiencia:
- apos selecionar o tipo de link a adicionar, no alerta apresentado o butao ""cancel"" nao parece funcionar
- se um elemento no editor visual estiver selecionado ao clicar num link na lista dos links para editar as propriedades parece nao mudar a janela"
