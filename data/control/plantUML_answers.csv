Thus, I cannot say it would drastically increase my productivity. Despite that, it appears to facilitate the creation of diagrams which can indeed make some parts of my job easier.","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Quite Agree","Strongly Agree","Quite Agree","Overall, it is very simple and straightforward to use.","Neither","Disagree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Agree","Neither","Disagree","Strongly Disagree","The usability is very good for a starting point, I would only add some minor improvements that would increase the engagement in the tool. For instances, associating each component with icons would increase the diagram edition speed, because one would not spend time searching in the dropdown menu for a given option. In addition to that, I would like to see more warnings (popups) just as a confirmation of what is being done to the diagram (e.g. Port added).","Yes","It is very important to don't lose time trying to mimic that feature ourselves.","Yes","This tool reminds me of draw.io and I would enjoy seeing a similar experience to that tool in this one. I consider a lot more engaging moving and ""feeling"" the elements in first hand.","No","I don't see people using the keyboard that much, it should support it anyway because of the accessibility","Yes","Although I am not sure, it seems that it follows all the UML standards.","I would like to see this extended to other type of files, for example github actions, pipelines, etc. This would highly increase this tool use cases."

I believe that it has more effect on the time it takes to perform the job and a bit less (although some) impact on its effectiveness. Without the tool, workers perform the job correctly but it may take more time. The preview might help with identifying some mistakes and correct them in time. ","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Quite Agree","Strongly Agree","The interface of the tool is clean and gives good feedback to the user, which makes it intuitive.

The features are naturally integrated with one another. In my opinion, to complete the sense of integration and give one final boost to the (already good) flow of the system I would include an option to create connections clicking on the elements (in addition to copying ids)","Yes","As in many scenarios, you can perform an action by mistake that is hard to reverse","Yes","It allows people to organize the elements a little bit better and more to their liking, which could be a factor in improving performance even more, especially when there are a great number of elements","Yes","I think the system works best with pointer control, but more accessibility is always important and I imagine that some keyboard shortcuts can also improve performance for users with more skill operating the system (as we see in other systems like the text editors)","Yes","It seems that way, but I would need to review the standards to give a more informed answer","A feature that I think could be interesting is a way to see a list of the element's connections maybe in its dropdown menu options"

Therefore, it would be both powerful and useful.","Slightly Agree","Quite Agree","Slightly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Quite Agree","Given that the underline language technology cannot be exchanged(in this little experiment this feature wasn't shown), even though I would find easy to operate this tool, it wouldn't allow the freedom to change the visual aspect of the diagram (e.g., font type, highlighting colors, etc). Nevertheless, I find that having standards to uniformize is important, but this feature could be implemented. It's easy to use for a software engineer, but there's a chance that the use of hashed IDs wouldn't be understood by someone not very tech savy. This backend behavior could be hidden in the frontend.","Agree","Disagree","Strongly Agree","Agree","Agree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Disagree","Strongly Agree","Disagree","The tool was very usable, the hash IDs could be occluded in the frontend. As this product is directed to people who use Docker on the daily, there's only a need to know that technology well. The connectors could be improved, perhaps they should be added at the top of the editor instead. Or an option to add a connection to another component should be added on the selection menu of a component.","Yes","A delete action that wasn't planned, or one that was planned but after some changes there's a sudden realization that it made sense in that system. I think the feature of middle crossing the deleted element is welcome and well realized.","Yes","For people with ADHD that's a really important feature, I find it impossible to not group certain components together, for instance, networks, or change their order. Nevertheless, it's important to give liberty to the user, even though the majority of users might not even utilize it, others might find it really important.","Yes","For a tool whose purpose is efficiency, to maximize it some shortcuts would be really useful.","Yes","It's written in a ""well documented"" language (plantuml). The responsibility falls on the developers of the language.","The hash IDs could be occluded in the frontend. Give a tl;dr to explain the type of  connections. Private repositories. Specify the folder of docker-compose files. Is it possible to use more than one docker-compose file, is there folder recursion?"

The drop down menus make it so that even someone like me who as never used the language can quickly understand how things can be added by exploring the available options without visiting the documentation. I feel like it would be very useful to make quick changes to an architecture diagram even after a long time without visiting a project.","Quite Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","Strongly Agree","It is easy to understand what types of boxes and connections can be added and how their properties can be changed.
