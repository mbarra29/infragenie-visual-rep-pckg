# Infragenie Visual Editor Prototype Experiment Replication Package

This repository is the replication package for the empirical study executed in context of the 'A Visual Editor for Creating Living Software Architecture Documentation' thesis. 

## Goal

Collect data to reach conclusions on the usability and user experience of the Visual Editor developed for Infragenie compared to the updated PlantUML editor. The PlantUML editor used will be the one that is updated to ensure that the available features are as close as they can be between the two editors.

## Contents

This repository contains a *README.md*, the experiment protocol PDF, and three folders with contents described below:

- **data** - This folder contains two subfolders (**control** and **experimental**) that store the answers collected on both versions of the evaluation forms and the data available in the pull requests created by each participant in their **repo_files** folder. These data are used to execute the statistical analysis of the participant's responses and evaluate the correctness of the tasks they executed.

- **forms** - This folder contains the **three PDF files** of the **Google Forms** created in the context for this experiment, which is the profile questions form and both versions of the evaluation forms.

- **notebooks** - This folder contains the **groups** and **evaluation** Jupyter notebooks. The **groups** notebook is where the **the profile questions** form is analyzed, while the **evaluation** notebook stores the **analysis of the data collected on both evaluation forms**.

The README file contains a comprehensible description of the contents of the empirical package and how to use them to replicate the experiment. The Evaluation Experiment Protocol PDF is a document used to plan the experiment and contains a detailed description of the several stages of planning and execution.

The forms can be used to obtain more data for a similar experiment, while the notebooks can be executed with possible new data collected to reach updated versions of the tables and plots generated.

## Execution and Main Findings

The details about the execution and main findings obtained by running this experiment can be found in the thesis document that will be shortly made available.
